class Tello:
    '''
    The main class for the Tello library. Used to construct a socket that will send & receive data from any
    Tello Ryze drone. If an IP address or any ports were provided they will be used in the construction of the sockets.
    Made for the v2.0 and v1.3 of the Tello Ryze SDK. For anything video related, ffmpeg must be installed.
    Kwargs are nicknamed preferences for semantic reasons

    # Parameters
    - ips?: The IP addresses you would like the Tello sockets to bind & connect to. There must be at least 1 IP address with others inputted as None.
    First one is for the command and state servers, second one is for the video server (ipv4/ipv6, Defaults to 192.168.10.1, 0.0.0.0)
    - ports?: The ports you would like the Tello sockets to bind & connect to. There must be at least 2 ports with others inputted as None.
    First one is for the command server, second one is for the state server, third one is for the video server (Defaults to 8889, 8890, 11111)

    # Preferences
    - debug?: Enable/Disable the debug mode for verbose console logging (Defaults to False/Disabled)
    - default_distance?: The default distance you would like the drone to move if none is provided during a movement function (Defaults to 50cm)
    - default_rotation?: The default degrees you would like the drone to rotate if none is provided during a movement function (Defaults to 90deg, must be between 1 - 360deg)
    - default_speed?: The default speed you would like the drone to move at (Defaults to 30cm/s, must be between 10 - 60cm/s)
    - mission_pad?: Enable/Disable the detection of mission pads (Defaults to False/Disabled)
    - safety?: Enable/Disable automatically landing the drone if an error is raised within the class while it's flying (Defaults to True/Enabled)
    - sync?: Make library as synchronous by default. Meaning if no callback value is provided to certain methods, it will default to None instead of False. If a function is provided for this preference, it will be set to the default callback for every method. Does not include video methods (Defaults to True/Enabled)
    - syncfix?: Enable/Disable preventing commands going out of sync, if an asynchronous method hasn't completed when a synchronous method is called it will wait for the asynchronous task to complete (Defaults to True/Enabled)
    - timeout?: The amount of time you would like to wait for a response from a drone before a timeout error is raised. If 0 is provided it will have no timeout (Defaults to 7s)
    - takeoff?: Enable/Disable automatically making the drone takeoff on class construction. Unchangeable after construction (Defaults to False/Disabled)
    - video?: Enable/Disable video on by default. Will send the streamon command to the drone. Unchangeable after construction (Defaults to False/Disabled)

    # Constants
    - M1-8: Mission pad values used for methods that require a mission pad as a parameter
    - HD: Resolution value that represents the 1280 x 720 (720p) for methods that have a resolution parameter
    - SD: Resolution value that represents the 852 x 480 (480p) for methods that have a resolution parameter
